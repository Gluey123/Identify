This will be used to hold all of my Identify scripts in the NIST framework.
I will have areas for linux/unix and Windows. I may later include macOS.
I will also have areas for each script depending on what it will be indentifying. Software or hardware, or more specifically applications and the versions. As well as hardware specs like hard drive space, memory ect...
Thanks for taking a look.
