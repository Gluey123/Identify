This will be used to hold all of my Identify scripts in the NIST framework.
I will have areas for linux/unix and Windows. I may later include macOS.
I will also have areas for each scipt depending on what it will be indenttifying. Software or hardware, or more specifically applications and the versions. As well as hardware specs like hard drive space, memory ect...
Thanks for taking a look. And if your on my team, may our blue be strong.
